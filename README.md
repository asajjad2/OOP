Question 1: Overlapping rectangles – A rectangle is identified by its four coordinates, as shown in the
figure below. Make a structure to hold data for every rectangle, there is bare minimum information that
you to store for each rectangle i.e. its coordinates. You can also improvise and make additional members
in the structure if you think it will help in doing any of the following tasks. Write the following functions:
1. Generate n number of rectangles
2. Find and return the area of all the rectangles, given the rectangles in the above format
3. Sort and return all rectangles in the ascending order based on their area.
4. Find the set of rectangles that overlap the largest rectangle
5. Write a function main (as a controller) to call the above functions in the correct order to identify
the set of rectangles that overlap the largest rectangle

Question 2: Smart mirror – You customize smart mirrors for your customers. For each customer the
options that they may want to display on smart mirror may include: upcoming Tasks, Time, Weekly

Question 4: Simulate Court Piece Card Game – In this game there are four players in fixed partnerships,
partners sitting opposite. Cards are dealt and game is played anticlockwise. Make a structure A standard
pack has four suits, the cards in each suit are ranked from high to low A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2.

Question 5: Table Tennis Fantasy League - You have to develop a table tennis fantasy league. Here are the
details of league: no. of teams (4) and no. of player per team (3). Each team will have to play the other
